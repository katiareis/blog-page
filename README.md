#Learning about CSS Flexbox - Origamid Course


About this course completion project:
In the CSS Flexbox course we learn how to create a responsive layout in CSS using only Flexbox properties. 
This way you no longer need to set fixed values and float elements to create your layout.

Let's start with the basics, going through all the properties and what they do in CSS. After these we create a real project to put the learning into practice.
